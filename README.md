How to use:

Windows operating systems will already have "Windows Powershell" installed.

- Type "Windows Powershell" into the Windows Start Menu

- Copy-paste the Superglide Practice Tool script directly from the link below into the Powershell window.

- Press 'Enter' to start the script. 

Pressing "Ctrl-C" within the Powershell window will terminate the script when you are finished, or you can exit out of the Powershell window. 

!!! Important Note !!!

In some cases, at higher FPSs the tool may under-estimate the chance of you hitting a superglide.
The reason for this is known, I just need to do more testing to identify which FPSs are effected before implementing a fix.
